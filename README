This is a slight modification to the classic bin packing algorithm.  Instead of having a finite 
set of boxes that need to be packed it assumes a bin, a given box and figures out how
many boxes  of that size fit in the bin

I used it for figuring how to cut material with least amount of waste

run it:

groovy pack3d.groovy 5,5,5 1,1,1
